2. As someone trying to maintain consistent habits, I want to be able to easily delete habits so I can eliminate old and unnecessary distractions
3. As someone who struggles with consistency, I want to see my historical trends so I can identify patterns and plan around them
4. As a visual learner, I want to see my habits represented in calendars so that I can easily track my patterns
5. As someone who has both short and long term goals, I want to be able to set separate timelines for each habit
6. As someone who struggles with consistency, I want to see my historical trends so I can identify patterns and plan around them
7. As someone building multiple habits, I want to categorize habits by time of the day so that I can create structured daily flows
8. As someone motivated by progress, I want to celebrate milestone achievements (like weekly or monthly streaks) with visual rewards or encouraging messages so that I feel recognized for my commitment
9. As someone who forgets to check apps regularly, I want customizable reminder notifications at different times so that I can stay on track
10. As someone who uses accessibility features, I want the app to work well with screen readers and voice commands so that I can track habits regardless of my physical abilities
11. As someone building progressive habits, I want to track increasing goals (minutes read/ steps taken) so that I can build momentum over time
